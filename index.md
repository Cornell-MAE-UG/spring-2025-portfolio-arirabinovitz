## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 My name is Ari Rabinovitz, and I am a Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University.
I am passionate about exploring space further, and plan to receive a Master's of Science in Aerospace
 Engineering. I have gone into depth on a variety of baseline engineering subjects such as Statics, Dynamics,
  Heat Trasnfer, Fluids, and Materials, and more complex subjects such as Introduction to Spacelfight
   Mechanics, Aerospace Propulsion, and Intermediate Dynamics. I am excited to work on design projects,
    and am the leader of the arm sub-team for the Cornell Mars Rover Project Team, where we build a rover
     that completes tasks such as picking up rocks, operating a joystock, and typing on a keyboard. I am
      excited to have you look at my work. Additionally, I am proud of my work this past semester in my Heat Transfer and Fluids Laboratory course.
